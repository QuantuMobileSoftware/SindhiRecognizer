# SindhiRecognizer

## Description
This simple project used Support Vector Machine to recognize Sindhi letters. There are three main files. `SVM_Trainer.py` is used to generate pre-trained `model.pkl`. `SVM_Classifier` is used to classify which letter is in the image. `model.pkl` was generated by `SVM_Trainer.py`, used by `SVM_Classifier` and consist file pre-trained on images in `img/` folder.

## Technologies
* Python
* OpenCV
* Scikit-Learn

## Usage
To train the model you need to have `.jpg` files named 1, 2, 3 etc. and `.docx` files named at the same way, that consist letters which need to be recognized. This command generate `model.pkl`:

```
python SVM_Trainer.py -p user/image/ -q 150
```

To classify the images you need to run the following command:

```
python SVM_Classifier.py -i image.jpg
```

To classify images via Docker container:

```
docker-compose up
```
